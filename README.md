Project for basic learning about React.

In this challenge, I developed a task control application in the **to-do list** style, which contains the following features:

- Add a new task
- Mark and unmark a task as completed
- Remove a task from the list
- Show task completion progress

Despite having few features, I learned concepts such as:

- States
- Immutability of the state
- Lists and keys in ReactJS
- Properties
- Componentization
